/** 
 *  Renders a molecule on the graphics pane from different positions.
 *  
 *  A molecule consists of a collection of molecule elements, i.e., atoms.
 *  Each atom has a type (eg, Carbon, or Hydrogen, or Oxygen, ..),
 *  and a three dimensional position in the molecule (x, y, z).
 *
 *  Each molecule is described in a file by a list of molecule elements (atoms) and their positions.
 *  The molecule is rendered by drawing a colored circle for each atom.
 *  The size and color of each atom is determined by the type of the atom.
 * 
 *  The description of the size and color for rendering the different types of
 *  atoms is stored in the file "atom-definitions.txt" which should be read and
 *  stored in a Map.  When an atom is rendered, the type should be looked up in
 *  the map to find the size and color to pass to the atom's render() method
 * 
 *  A molecule can be rendered from different perspectives, and the program
 *  provides four buttons to control the perspective of the rendering.
 *  
 *  For interpreting the viewing positions indicated below, image the molecule to be in the
 *  centre of a clockface and the viewer rotating around the perimeter of the clockface.
 *   "Front" renders the molecule from the front (viewing position = 6 o'clock (0 degrees))
 *   "Back" renders the molecule from the back (viewing position = 12 o'clock (180 degrees))
 *   "Left" renders the molecule from the left (viewing position = 9 o'clock (-90 degrees))
 *   "Right" renders the molecule from the right (viewing position = 3 o'clock (90 degrees))
 *   "RotateLeft" rotates the viewing position by -50 seconds (-5 degrees),
 *   "RotateRight" rotates the viewing position by 50 seconds (5 degrees).
 *
 *  To make sure that the nearest atoms appear in front of the furthest atoms,
 *  the atoms must be rendered in order from the furthest away to the nearest.
 *  Each viewing position imposes a different ordering on the atoms.
