For your reflection:
====================

Write a paragraph that describes an aspect of the material we've covered 
so far (i.e. anything in the lectures to date, or this assignment) that 
you found particularly interesting or tricky to understand. Include how 
you went about exploring further, learning about the issue to your own 
satisfaction. If understanding it remains a problem for you, outline 
what your next step will be in sorting this out.

Working with Arrays(specfically 2d arrays) was diffacult because you are working with many indexes that
get jumbled especially when you aren't using a uniform system of refering to them (ie. row and col or i and j).
This put a lot of overflow errors and drawing things sideways into my code that had to be sorted out. 
I have now moved to a system of index referencing that makes sence and is consistant to fix and stop this problem in future.
