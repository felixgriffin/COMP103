For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. Please be specific about
what you attempted (core, completion, challenge, and any finer-grained goals,
if applicable). Please also state how successful you believe you were
respectively. If there were any problems you got stuck on, what were they?


* What is the point of comparators?  Why are they necessary in general?
  Could you suggest an alternative way of solving the same problems that didn't
  involve having to make these additional classes?

* Coming up with good test methods can be as hard as writing the code that it is
  testing.  Suggest some guidelines or principles for writing good test methods.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Part way thorough challange. I think i did pretty well mostly due to it just being fix these issues 
that you fixed last time anyway as the issues we where asked to fix where the common bugs that where in a prev assignment.


The point of comparitors is to compare two items which is used for sorting or choosing things based on their values.
Using a method insted of a whole class would be better or doing all the comparisons inside one class with diffrent methods.

Writing test methods as you go so you understand exactly what that method is for.
Making sure the feedback is descriptive as to what is broken.
